The file BlockSize.c contains the code in language C to find cache access latency for various positions of array
in order to find the size of cache block.

The file Associativity.c contains the code in language C to find cache access latency for various positions of array 
in order to find the associativity of cache.

Report file consists of brief explanation of the process used to find the block size and associativity of cache by using 
BlockSize.c and Associativity.c and explanation to ISA instructions used in the codes.
